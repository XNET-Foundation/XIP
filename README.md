# XNET Improvement Proposals (XIP)

## Introduction to XIP Process
Purpose: Explain the purpose of the proposed XIP.
Types of Proposals: Proposals could include governance, technical changes, feature requests, community initiatives, or partnership opportunities.
### Who Can Submit a Proposal?
We need to establish specific eligibility criteria, if any (e.g., minimum token holding, length of community membership).
### XIP Format
Title: Clear, concise title summarizing the proposal.
Author(s): List of the main contributors to the proposal.
Summary: A brief overview (100-200 words) that outlines the purpose and intent of the proposal.
Rationale: Explanation of the problem being addressed or the improvement being proposed and why it is necessary.
Proposal Details: Step-by-step breakdown of the proposal, including implementation methods, timelines, and resources required.
Impact Assessment: A description of the potential impact on the XNET network and the community.
Voting Options: Provide clear voting choices (e.g. For, Against, Abstain, %, $ etc.) 
### Proposal Submission Process
Step 1: Discussion
All XIP ideas will first be shared within the DAO community for open discussion (e.g., on Discord, forums, and WG meetings).
Step 2: Drafting the Proposal
After receiving community feedback, the author can draft a formal submission following the approved format.
Implement Foundation GitHub as the DAO-approved platform for proposal drafting.
### Proposal Review Process
Preliminary Review: WG council and community review the proposal for completeness and alignment with XNETâ€™s goals and guidelines.
Feedback Period: Allow a set period (e.g., 5-7 days) for the community to provide feedback or request clarification. The proposal may be updated based on community feedback.
### Voting Process
Step 1: Voting Eligibility
Outline the eligibility criteria for voting (e.g., token holders, minimum token stake).
Step 2: Voting Period
Set a clear start and end date for the voting period (e.g., 7 days).
Include details about how to cast a vote and the voting options available (Yes, No, Abstain).
Step 3: Voting Outcome
If the proposal passes a pre-determined quorum, it moves to the implementation phase.
If the quorum is not met, the proposal is either rejected or sent back for further discussion and refinement.
#### Implementation
If the proposal is approved, outline the steps for implementation, including any budget allocations, development teams, timelines, or milestones.
Regular updates should be posted to ensure transparency throughout the process.
### Monitoring and Reporting
After implementation, the community should have access to regular progress reports.
Establish a process for evaluating the success or failure of the proposal and its impact on the ecosystem.
### Appeal or Amendment Process
If a proposal is rejected, outline how it can be appealed or amended for resubmission.
Clear guidelines for how a failed or partially implemented XIP can be revisited.
This outline ensures that the WG follows a transparent and structured process for submitting and approving community-driven proposals. You can further adapt this depending on the specific tools and governance structures XNET is using.
