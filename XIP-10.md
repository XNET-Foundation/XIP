# XIP-10 : Unemitted Supply Burn Mechanism
## Summary
This XIP proposes a significant reduction in the total supply of XNET tokens to address concerns about future dilution and incentivize network development. This reduction will be achieved through a burn mechanism that will burn a portion of future emissions proportionally among the existing token pools.

The burn rate will start high and gradually decrease over time, ensuring a significant reduction in total supply while maintaining a sustainable emission schedule. This proposal aims to optimize XNET's tokenomics for long-term growth and stability.

## Rationale
Before the move to Solana, XIP 3 was introduced and passed to address XNET‚Äôs irregular token supply overhang. The XNET community implemented a 90% supply reduction, which has helped, but did not completely solve the problem. It still has left XNET with a smaller circulating supply to total supply percentage compared to industry peers.

| Value        | XNET   | Helium | World Mobile | 
|-------------:|:-------|--------|:-------------|
| Circ. Tokens | 64.12M | 170.5M | 576M         |
| Total Tokens | 2.4B   | 223M   | 2B           |
| Float        | 2.67%  | 76.4%  | 28.8%        |

The original tokenomics envisioned a need for larger long-tail token distributions to incentivize development 10+ years in the future. This gave the appeal of flexible future emission concepts, but at the expense of long term dilution of the circulating supply. However, the fundamental DePIN flywheel is designed to drive rapid growth to reach network scale within a 5-10 year period, after which the fundamental emissions/burn model should stabilize. Therefore, a large unemitted supply is unnecessary, and in fact serves to undermine the initial bootstrapping phase of network development due to future dilution uncertainty.

The project does not need nearly as many tokens as were kept during the migration, so this XIP proposes a reduction in the total supply based on a multiple of emissions over the next 26 epochs. This burn will come purely from future emissions and can be split on a pro rata share across the emission pools.

## Proposal Details
### Unemitted XNET Burn

The burn will be based on a multiple of the total emissions per epoch, starting in Epoch 50. At the end of each epoch, the total emissions towards coverage & validation, data, and bonuses will be multiplied by the future supply reduction factor. This factor will be very large (450x) to start in order to address the total supply within a short time, and then will reduce substantially once total supply drops below 1.0B (20x). The factor will remain at 20x until the end of Epoch 75 or at a floor supply of 850M, at which point the burn mechanism will be eliminated entirely.

Total Burn per Epoch, TB = (RCV+RD+RB)  kFSR
RCV = Coverage & Validation Rewards 
RD =Data Rewards 
RB =Bonus Rewards 
kFSR =Future Supply Reduction Factor 

### Burn Per Pool
The burn will be done as a pro rata share across the existing token pools of unallocated tokens.

Operator Pool Burn = 0.4969 TB
Foundation Pool Burn = 0.2089 TB
Investor Pool Burn = 0.0658 TB
Insider Pool Burn = 0.0746 TB
Ecosystem Pool Burn = 0.1539 TB

### Maximum Burn Cap
The total burn will be capped to not reduce the supply below 850M XNET. This burn is independent of the data buy/burn, so the total supply can continue to reduce based on the future buy/burn mechanism.
For example, if the actual emissions exceed the projected emissions, and the total burn amount from this proposal would drop the total supply below 850M XNET, the supply reduction factor would be changed so that the total supply drops to exactly 850M XNET. Also, the supply reduction factor would be set to 0 for all Epochs following this occurrence. 

### Impact Assessment
The XIP was modeled based on the XNET Foundation‚Äôs emissions projections.
The impact to total supply is projected to be a reduction from 2.4B XNET to 850M XNET over a 1 year period.
The impact to the community will be a lower impact of long term dilution of the token supply.
